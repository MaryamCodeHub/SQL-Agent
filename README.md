# SQL Agent for Natural Language Query Processing
## Technical Documentation Report

### 1. Introduction

The SQL Agent is an advanced natural language processing system designed to bridge the gap between human language queries and database operations. This agent serves as an intelligent intermediary that can interpret natural language questions, generate appropriate SQL queries, execute them against a database, and present the results in both tabular and visual formats.

The system represents a significant step forward in making database interactions more accessible to non-technical users while maintaining the robustness and precision required for database operations. By combining modern language models with traditional database management systems, it creates a powerful tool for data analysis and exploration.
